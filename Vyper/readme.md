To help you prepare, or at least become a little familiar with Vyper, I highly recommend exploring the Vyper documentation: https://docs.vyperlang.org/. A tutorial on Vyper that I've particularly enjoyed is the following one, brought to you by the Curve Finance team: https://github.com/curvefi/vyper-tutorial.

## Extra:

- Brownie Tutorial 1 -- Welcome and Introduction
    - Solidity is turning complete ( 2014 -> inspired from JAVA )
    - Vyper is not turning complete for security reasons ( Based on Python however python lang is turing complete ) (2018)
    - Turing complete simply means that it allows any type of calculations
    - Turing complete program is haltable, it might run an infinite loop that will never end and that's not good if you are running a decentralized network
    - Brownie handles both lang
- Brownie Tutorial 2 -- Installation
