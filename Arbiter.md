## Arbiter

ðŸ›  Arbiter is a tool for executing EVM logic quickly and accurately by interfacing with the Rust implementation of EVM called Revamp.

ðŸ”„ Simulations in Arbiter involve stochastic price paths, multiple agent types, and customizable environments for testing DeFi smart contracts.

ðŸ“Š Arbiter records simulation output, allowing for data analysis, visualization, and statistical analysis.

ðŸ’ª Arbiter aims to be a versatile tool, allowing users to simulate and interact with real networks like Ethereum mainnet or layer twos.

âš™ Existing tools lacked the desired performance and features required for comprehensive smart contract vulnerability analysis and mechanism design evaluation.

ðŸš€ Arbiter offers back testing and forward testing capabilities, enabling granular performance analysis and composability in the ecosystem design.

ðŸ“ˆ Arbiter's performance has shown significant improvements compared to other tools, with the ability to process over a thousand swaps per second.
