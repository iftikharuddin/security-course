## Euler Vault Kit

**Governance Risk:**
- **Properties:** Upgradeable/Immutable and Governed/Finalised are independent properties of a vault and can be combined in any way.
- **Vault Kit Agnosticism:** The Euler Vault Kit allows creators to decide the governance risk, and the market determines which vaults receive liquidity rewards.
- **Governance Risk Profile:**
  - **Upgradeable:**
    - Governed: Factory admin and governor can make changes.
    - Finalised: Only factory admin can make changes.
  - **Immutable:**
    - Governed: Only the governor can make changes.
    - Finalised: No changes can be made.
- **Risks of Immutable/Finalised Vaults:**
  - Inability to reconfigure in response to changing market conditions or critical bugs.
- **Security Upgrade Policy:**
  - Factory admins should have a clear policy for security upgrades & evaluate their impact responsibly.
- **Challenge for Factory Admins:**
  - Fixing bugs for upgradeable vaults without exposing vulnerabilities in non-upgradeable ones requires careful consideration and security measures.
  
  
**Accounting in EVault Contracts:**

- **Vault Structure:** EVault contracts are ERC-4626 vaults with borrowing functionality, holding only one type of token, known as the underlying asset.
- **Vault Shares:** Represent proportional claims on the vault's assets, exchangeable for larger amounts of the underlying asset over time.
- **Exchange Rate:** Represents the value of each vault share in terms of the underlying asset. It grows over time as interest accrues.
- **Calculation:** The exchange rate is computed by dividing the total assets (cash + total borrows) by the total number of shares.
- **Precision Consideration:** To avoid precision loss, the exchange rate calculation incorporates a "virtual deposit," which is like a deposit at a 1:1 exchange rate, ensuring a defined exchange rate even when there are no outstanding shares initially.
- **Equation:** Exchange Rate = (Cash + Total Borrows + Virtual Deposit) / (Total Shares + Virtual Deposit)

**When a depositor wants to withdraw assets from the vault:**
- The quantity of assets they can redeem for a given number of shares is always `rounded down`. This ensures that depositors cannot withdraw more assets than they originally deposited plus any interest earned.
- Conversely, the number of shares required to withdraw a given quantity of assets is `rounded up`. This ensures that depositors cannot withdraw fewer assets than they are entitled to based on their shares.

### DToken
- The DToken is a read-only ERC-20 interface provided by vaults to represent debts owed within the system. It allows for clear tracking of debt modifications, triggering Transfer logs whenever a debt amount changes. These logs represent the net change in debt, which includes repayments and accrued interest. While the DToken contract doesn't support transfers or approvals, advanced users seeking debt portability can utilize the pullDebt() function on the vault contract, provided the controller vault allows it.
- The DToken contract is the first (and only) contract created by EVault, so its address can be calculated from the vault's address and the nonce 1.

### Balance Forwarding
- Balance forwarding is a method used to incentivize liquidity providers beyond interest earnings.
- Instead of embedding rewards directly into vault contracts, balance forwarding notifies an external contract of balance changes, chosen by the vault governor. 
- This approach offers instant and trustless reward distribution without increasing gas costs for all users. 
- However, the chosen external contract, typically Rewards Streams, must be audited to ensure reliability and gas efficiency.

### Interest

- **Interest:** In the context of the system, interest is accrued on borrowed amounts and earned on deposited amounts.

- **Compounding:** Compounding refers to the process where interest is calculated on both the principal amount and any accumulated interest from previous periods. In this system, vaults compound interest deterministically every second using exponentiation, which means they calculate interest based on the continuously growing balance including previously accrued interest.

- **Deterministic Compounding:** Vaults compound interest using exponentiation, which means they calculate interest precisely rather than using an approximation method like polynomial approximation. This ensures that the amounts owed or earned are accurate and independent of how frequently the contract is interacted with, except for interactions that result in changes to the interest rate or accumulator rounding.

- **Accumulation of Interest:** Interest is accumulated on the first transaction in a block, meaning that actual time must pass for any interest to be accrued. However, whenever the balance or debt amounts change, a new interest rate is targeted. This process occurs in the `checkVaultStatus` function, ensuring that batches of transactions interacting with a vault multiple times only need to re-target the interest rate once. This helps optimize the efficiency of interest rate adjustments.

### Interest Rate Models (IRMs)

Interest Rate Models (IRMs) are contracts used by vaults to determine the interest rates borrowers must pay based on the vault's state. The most common model is the "linear-kink" model, which adjusts interest rates based on the utilization of the vault's assets.

IRMs calculate interest rates using functions like `computeInterestRate`, which takes utilization as input. They can also request additional information from the vault.

Interest rates are typically measured in "second percent yield" (SPY) values, which represent per-second compounded interest rates.

When a vault has `address(0)` installed as an IRM, an interest rate of `0%` is assumed. If a call to the vault's IRM fails, the vault will ignore this failure & continue with the previous interest rate.

While most IRMs are simple functions, vaults may directly call them to update interest rates. IRMs must ensure that the caller is the vault and also provide a method called computeInterestRateView for getting updated rates without changing state.

### Fees
When interest is accrued in the vault, a portion of it is allocated to fees, similar to reserves in other protocols. The governor sets the `interestFee` parameter, controlling the fraction of interest allocated to fees. Each borrower's liability increases accordingly with interest fees. Fees are charged by diluting depositors' shares by the `interestFee` fraction of the interest. These fees, denominated in vault shares, earn compound interest over time.

To efficiently track fees, they are stored in a virtual account within the vault. A `convertFees()` method can be called to convert these fees into regular shares redeemable for the underlying asset. This method calculates the newly accrued shares since the last call & determines the portion due to the Euler DAO & its receiver address. The remaining shares are transferred to the `feeReceiver` address specified by the vault's governor, or to the Euler DAO's receiver if no `feeReceiver` is specified.

### ProtocolConfig
The ProtocolConfig contract represents the Euler DAO's interests within the vault kit ecosystem and regulates the control that vaults allow it. It sets limits on what actions can be controlled by the DAO, with permanent enforcement for non-upgradeable vaults.

ProtocolConfig exposes two key methods for vault interaction:

1. isValidInterestFee(): Validates whether an interest fee value falls within the allowed range (10% to 100%). Vaults call this method when the governor attempts to set an interest fee.

2. feeConfig(): Called during fee conversion, it returns:
   - feeReceiver: The address where the DAO's share of the fees should be sent.
   - protocolFeeShare: The fraction of interest fees allocated to the DAO. If this value exceeds 50%, vaults use 50% instead.
   
   
### Risk Management
The Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC) employs risk management measures by requiring vaults to implement two essential methods:

1. checkAccountStatus: This method checks whether a specified account is in violation. It verifies if the account has enough collateral to cover its liabilities.

2. checkVaultStatus: This method assesses the overall health of the vault itself. It examines if the vault has surpassed any predefined limits, such as borrow and supply caps.

These methods are called by the EVC as needed, often after completing all operations in a batch. This allows for deferred checks, providing a form of flash liquidity. If a vault indicates a failed status check, the transaction is reverted, undoing all previously executed operations.   

# Audit data

## Privileged actors
Accounts owners
- **Description**: An Ethereum address that controls a total of 256 EVC accounts.
- **Permissions**: setNonce, setOperator, setAccountOperator, enableCollateral, disableCollateral
, reorderCollaterals, enableController, disableController, permit, call, batch.
- **Trusted by**: The corresponding 256 EVC accounts determined by the ownerâ€™s 19 left-most bytes.

## Account operators
- **Description**: An address approved to execute a set of functions on behalf of a given EVC account.
- **Permissions**: Same as account owners except setNonce and setOperator.
- **Trusted by**: EVC accounts.

## Controller vaults
- **Description**: The borrowed-from (liability) vaults.
- **Permissions**: controlCollateral, forgiveAccountStatusCheck, disableController, and
functions related to the account and vault status checks.
- **Trusted by**: Collateral vaults (and vice versa).

## Design choices
- The EVC implements a custom TransientStorage contract. If EIP-1153 gets accepted, and transient storage becomes natively supported by the EVM before the project launches, this code
may be rewritten.
- Each Ethereum address has a total of 256 accounts in the EVC distinguished by the last 1 byte of
the address. While this reduces the security of addresses by 8 bits, there remains a comfortable
security margin. Itâ€™s important to note that if a userâ€™s private key is compromised, all accounts
owned by that user will also be compromised.
- Owners can set the operator address for any account, whereas operators can only unset themselves from accounts theyâ€™ve been assigned to.
- Sequentially signed permit messages can be invalidated simultaneously if the owner updates
  the nonce for the corresponding nonce namespace.
- Collateral vaults should trust controller vaults, and vice versa
- Account status checks are required even in `reorderCollateral` and `enableCollateral`, which
  do not affect an accountâ€™s solvency. This abstract approach allows controller vaults to craft more
  customized rules
- Disabling a controller in the EVC requires the call to come from the controller itself, not the user.
- During an external call, any address can insert itself into the account and vault status check sets
  if checks are deferred, potentially forcing the transaction to revert.
- Precompiles cannot be used as addresses for permit, but the validation logic should change if
the contract is deployed on other chains.
- The `getPermitHash` functions writes into the Free Memory Pointer slot but clears it right after.
- The EVC is written in a highly abstracted manner to allow flexibility and avoid making specific
  assumptions about vaults implementations.


## Tips
- Whenever an operation affects an accountâ€™s solvency in a controller vault, the Ethereum
 Vault Connector triggers the `checkAccountStatus` function in the respective controller vault(s)
