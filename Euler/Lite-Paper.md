## Euler v2 Lite Paper - The Modular Lending Platform
- two main components
    - the Euler Vault Kit (EVK), which empowers builders to deploy and chain together their own customised lending vaults in a permissionless manner
    - the Ethereum Vault Connector (EVC), a powerful, immutable, primitive which give vaults superpowers by allowing their use as collateral for other vaults
    
### Euler Vault Kit (EVK)
- Euler v2 is a system of ERC-4626 vaults built using a custom-built vault development kit, called the EVK, and chained together using the EVC.
Alright, let's break this down into simpler terms:

**Euler v2 Basics:**
- **Vault System:** Euler v2 is a system that uses vaults (like digital safes) to manage different types of financial activities.
- **Custom Development:** It's built using a kit called the EVK (Euler Vault Kit), which lets people create their own vaults.
- **Connecting Vaults:** These vaults are connected together using something called the EVC (Euler Vault Chain).

**Types of Vaults:**
1. **Core Vaults:** These are like special vaults for lending money. They're managed in a way to lower risks and make lending and borrowing smoother for users.
2. **Edge Vaults:** These are more flexible. They let people create their own lending markets without strict rules. It's like having your own mini-bank.
3. **Escrow Vaults:** These are simple vaults that hold tokens to use as collateral. They help keep things safe for both lenders and borrowers.

**New Features:**
