## Value Proposition
- Fat-dApp thesis - An all-in-one platform for yield optimization including auto-compounding, higher APRs on supplied assets, and the ability to take out loans.
- Support for any ERC-20 token - Curvance is founded with the aim of unlocking further capital efficiency on yield-bearing assets. The modular approach of the vault technology allows the support of any ERC-20 token. The platform can integrate any protocol and any market with ease as long there is sustained and proven demand from users.
- Cross-chain Equivalence - Aligned with a multichain world, the platform is built using `Wormholeâ€™s` tech stack to deploy on multiple chains. This includes its money market and accompanying gauges.
- Security First - The markets are secured using a dual oracle system, circuit breaker functionalities, and audits by notable firms to ensure utmost stability and user trust.
- Modular Architecture - Curvance is built with composability in mind. The implementation of ERC-4626 vaults allows for a standardized approach and opens the opportunity for other parties to come in and build their solutions on top of Curvance.
- Improved Tech Stack - The platform is built from the ground up featuring crosschain voting, liquidity routing, a custom liquidation engine, and improved tokenomics.
