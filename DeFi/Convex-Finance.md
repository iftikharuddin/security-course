# Convex Finance
- Convex Finance vs Yearn Finance Quick Contraster
    - Convex Finance - Boosted Curve Staking
        - purely focused on Curve Finanace
        - it helps curve user to get more rewards and boosts
        - the flow is like this, user stake in Curve -> they get LP tokens -> they use that LP tokens in Convex and stake it in Convex, this way you will get boosted rewards from everyone who supplied CRV to the respective pool
        - Convex also supply you with with their gov tokens as rewards (CVX APR)
        - Convex doesn't sell any token for you, it just boosts it -> gets you more CRV -> you will have to claim it!
    - Yearn Finance
        - YF also gives you boost rewards on the LP Tokens you staked however it doesn't give you GOV Tokens as Convex do!
        - What YF can do is send the LP tokens to convex and farm the gov tokens convex gives :)
        - YF sells the tokens directly for you and gets you USDC rewards.
