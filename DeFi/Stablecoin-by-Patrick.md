# How to make a Stablecoin 
- A stablecoin is a non-volatile crypto asset.
- Stable buying power.
- 3 functions of money 
    - Store of value
    - unit of account
    - medium of exchange
- Summary is that a stable coin is a crypto asset whose buying power stays relatively the same.
- MakerDAO (MKR) is Collateralized Debt Position (CDP)
    - A collateralized debt position (CDP) is the position created by locking collateral in MakerDAO's smart contract to generate its decentralized stablecoin, DAI

### Stable coin categories
- Relative stability
    - Pegged/Anchor or floating
- Stability method
    - Goverend or algorithm 
- Collateral Type
    - Endogenous or exogenous
    - exogenous (external collateral, so if the protocol fails the external collateral is safe)
    
### DAI
- How DAI/Maker Dao Works?
    - You deposit ETH, you gets DAI
    - DAI is always less than your deposit ( bcz over-collateralized )
    - If you want to get your collateral back, you return the DAI which is burned and you get your ETH
    - Collateralized DEBT Position (CDP)
    
### Patrick Stable coin notes
- (Relative Stability) Anchored or pegged -> $1.00
    - Chainlink price feeds for fetching price data
    - Set a function to exchange ETH & BTC -> $$$
- Stability Mechanism (Minting) -> Algorithmic -> Decentralized
    - People can only mint the stablecoin with enough collateral ( coded )
- Collateral -> Exogenous -> Crypto
    - wETH and wBTC as collateral
