- @Cobie is Jordan Fish :D
- Lido is a liquid staking protocol
    - it let you stake proof of stake crypto currency without having to lock them up
    - when you stake ETH through beacan chain in LIDO it gives you stETH as receipt for crypto you stake
    - stETH mirros the price of ETH and can be traded 
- stETH pegs its price in 3 ways
    - arbitrage
    - liquidity mining (ETH/stETH)
    - organic demand ( since stETH earns staking rewards in real time it's the idea collateral for borrowing protocols such as Aave & Maker DAO)
    - the fact that stETH earns staking rewards in real timings means that its value changes which makes it in-compatable with certain DeFi Protocols e.g decentralized exchange uniswap
    - for this issue handling we have `wstETH` which essentially make it possible for stETH to continue increasing in value while maintaining a fix price for dex trading
    - when you stake ETH into LIDO it distributes it to 22 validators on ETH beacon chain that is vet by LIDO DAO
    - LDO token with 1 Billion Supply, is used in LIDO DAO voting
