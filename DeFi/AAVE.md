## AAVE

- Aave is a decentralized finance protocol founded by `Stani Kulechov` in 2017
- Back then it was known as `ETHLAND` then it re-branded to `Aave` in 2018
- `Aave` development is community driven rather than company driven
    - Aave raised 16m$ in 2017 ICOs
    - another 33 m$ in various funding rounds from other VCs
- Inititally it launched on ETH Main net, now it is on Avax, POLYGON, Arbitrum, OP, Fantom & Harmony
- Aave is currently the 2nd largest DeFi protocol, first is MAKER DAO by TVL
- Aave allows you to lend/borrow without KYC, without timelimits on loans/deposits
- Borrow:
    - To borrow crypto on `Aave` you need to deposit the $ amount more than the $ amount you need to borrow, strange right?
    - This is called an overcollatralized loan
    
- The interest rate you pay on the crypto you borrow is determined by the supply of and demand 
for the token you are borrowing in the protocol; with a lower of supply and higher demand for the token corresponding to higher interest rate.

- A higher interest rate incentivize borrowers to borrow less of that token and incentivize lenders to depost
more of that token into the protocol.

- Naturally the interest being paid on borrow token goes to the lender of those tokens.
- And on Aave borrowers can even upto a higher stable interest rate.
- As we discussed that there are no time-limits for loans however there is a catch; 
borrowers must always make sure that the $ value of the crypto these used as collateral is worth 
more than the $ value of the crypto they borrowed + the interest they owe on the crypto they borrowed.
- If borrowers failed to maintain the sufficient collateral either bcz of the $ value of the collateral falls or the interest rate
on the collateral increase too much then the crypto they used as collateral liquidates. i.e sold to insure that the protocol remains solvant
- To insure that lenders can always withdraw; any token they deposit into Aave is put into the pools; the assumption being that the lenders will NOT withdraw all their crypto at the same time, and remained incentivize by interest rate
to insure that the protocol has enough tokens to meet borrowers demand.
- To insure that the protocol always remains solvent regardless of market volatility, holders of the Aave tokens can stake it in the
protocol to earn a percentage of protocol fees.
- In the exchange the Aave tokens being staked are liquidated in the event of a short falls.
- Aave staking rewards are currently 7% per year
- Aave token is used as governace token also
- Lens social network is launched by Aave
