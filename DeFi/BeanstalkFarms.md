# Beanstalk Part 1

- Beanstalk is a permissionless fiat stablecoin protocol built on Ethereum. Its primary objective is to incentivize independent market participants to regularly cross the price of 1 Bean over its dollar peg in a sustainable fashion.
  
- Beanstalk does not have any collateral requirements.
    - Beanstalk uses credit instead of collateral to create Bean price stability relative to its value peg of $1. 
    - The practicality of using DeFi is currently limited by the lack of decentralized low-volatility assets with competitive carrying costs.
    - Borrowing rates on USD stablecoins have historically been higher than borrowing rates on USD, even when supply increases rapidly. 
    - Non-competitive carrying costs are due to collateral requirements.
