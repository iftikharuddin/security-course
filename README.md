- Lesson 11. Stateless And Stateful Fuzzing Practice

    - Stateless Fuzzing: Calling a function with random data, a whole bunch of time
    - Stateful Fuzzing: Call a whole bunch of functions with a whole bunch of data, [no restrictions ->very randomness]
    - [fuzz]
      runs = 1000
      seed = '0x2'
     
    - the more the runs the more chances it catches bug, and seed is for unique results, so it is very important!
